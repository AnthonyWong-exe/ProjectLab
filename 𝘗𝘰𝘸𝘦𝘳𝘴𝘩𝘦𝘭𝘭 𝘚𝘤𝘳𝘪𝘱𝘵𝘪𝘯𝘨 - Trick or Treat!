With the help of YouTube videos and Microsoft training modules, I was able to grasp the fundamentals of PowerShell ISE to create a simple script. 
Having Python knowledge definitely made it easier for me to catch on, although the placement of parentheses and curly brackets was completely new to me.

The goal was to simulate a trick or treating game where a user can collect candy from different house and the script keeps track of the total amount of candy left.

Script:


$TotalCandy = 500
$House_A_Candy = 123
$House_B_Candy = 165
$House_C_Candy = 212

function CheckCandy {
    if ($TotalCandy -le 0) {
        $TotalCandy = 0
        Write-Host "All the candy has been collected! No candy left."
    } else {
        Write-Host "You have $TotalCandy pieces of candy left."
    }
}

while ($TotalCandy -gt 0) {
    $SelectedHouse = Read-Host -Prompt "Pick a house to trick or treat! (A, B, or C)"

    if ($SelectedHouse -eq "A") {
        if ($TotalCandy -ge $House_A_Candy) {
            Write-Host "You have chosen House A! It had $House_A_Candy pieces of candy."
            $TotalCandy -= $House_A_Candy
        } else {
            Write-Host "House A has more candy than what you can collect. You collected the remaining $TotalCandy pieces."
            $TotalCandy = 0
        }
    } elseif ($SelectedHouse -eq "B") {
        if ($TotalCandy -ge $House_B_Candy) {
            Write-Host "You have chosen House B! It had $House_B_Candy pieces of candy."
            $TotalCandy -= $House_B_Candy
        } else {
            Write-Host "House B has more candy than what you can collect. You collected the remaining $TotalCandy pieces."
            $TotalCandy = 0
        }
    } elseif ($SelectedHouse -eq "C") {
        if ($TotalCandy -ge $House_C_Candy) {
            Write-Host "You have chosen House C! It had $House_C_Candy pieces of candy."
            $TotalCandy -= $House_C_Candy
        } else {
            Write-Host "House C has more candy than what you can collect. You collected the remaining $TotalCandy pieces."
            $TotalCandy = 0
        }
    } else {
        Write-Host "Invalid choice! Please pick either A, B, or C."
    }

    CheckCandy
}

Write-Host "All candy has been collected. Trick or Treat time is over!"
