Recently, I finished the 'SOC Analyst Training Path' offered by letsdefend.io, and I'm thrilled to share my insights from the experience.
I found it incredibly valuable; while I was already familiar with some concepts, it was still beneficial to refine my skills and pick up new ones!

My favorite parts of this path were:
- 𝘔𝘐𝘛𝘙𝘌 𝘈𝘛𝘛&𝘊𝘒 𝘍𝘳𝘢𝘮𝘦𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘬
> I enjoy discovering the tactics hackers use to breach systems. It's a thrilling challenge that keeps me engaged. 
I first came across it during my Security+ studies and found it super interesting, so I wanted to learn more.
Understanding their tactics helps me stay a step ahead in protecting systems from attacks.

> Initially, I began my journey by studying the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities back in 2022,doing those PortSwigger labs—fun stuff like XXS and SQL injections.
I was so into it that I even purchased a year-long Burp Suite subscription! However, as I delved into more practical paths for career advancement, my focus shifted to different areas.
Now, though, I've got the chance to get back into OWASP. I'm excited to dive back in and see where it leads me in my cybersecurity journey. :)

> Exploring the Splunk & SIEM 101 section, I've gained a solid understanding of its purpose and its role in the cyber world. Building on what I already knew about SIEMs,
I realize how important it is. As I aim to secure my first tech role on the blue team side, I see mastering SIEM as crucial. It's a big part of success in this field,
and I'm putting a lot of focus on it. My plans include thorough exploration, testing, and analyzing my home network, malicious files, and anything else I can try out.
By spotting patterns and anomalies, I hope to strengthen my understanding of security protocols and get better at keeping networks safe.
