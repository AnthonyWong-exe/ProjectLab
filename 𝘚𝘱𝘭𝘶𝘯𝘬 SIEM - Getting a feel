✤ - Splunk Exploration - investigating datasets

While exploring the "Botsv3" dataset, I extracted valuable information from a large event list using various commands,
allowing me to find specific information in a timely and efficient manner,
and gaining an understanding of how this type of data is viewed in real world scenarios.


1 ~ Event Search:
   - I started by retrieving all events to gain clear view of the data at hand.

2 ~ Keyword Search:
   - Using keywords relevant to my investigation, such as "Error" or "Failed" identifies events that could indicate potential security incidents.

3 ~ Aggregating Data:
   - Aggregating data based on different fields, such as source IP addresses ('src_ip') or event types, revealed the frequency of specific source IPs.
Combining this with a keyword search could reduce the number of events searched through and make things smoother.

4 ~ Filtering by time:
   - Sorting by time allowed me to see which events happened within a 3 minute timeframe. Combining this with an IP + 
failed login search could help me determine whether a user login from a specific IP has been unsuccessful multiple times, indicating the possibility of a password attack.

5 ~ Filtering with Regex:
   - Using regular expressions, I applied filtering techniques to extract specific event patterns or characteristics from the dataset,
allowing for more targeted analysis and uncovering insights such as the frequency of occurrences of specific field-value pairs within the dataset.

✫ As I progress in Splunk, I aim to effectively filter through extensive amounts of log data to accurately find the necessary information (without overlooking important details).
Developing upon this skill will help me navigate datasets more effectively, leading to better decision making.
